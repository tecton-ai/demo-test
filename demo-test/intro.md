Welcome to the Tecton Interactive Walkthrough. This walkthrough is intended to get you started working with Tecton.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Use declarative code to put a feature into production.
2. Push data to the Feature Store.
3. Retrieve feature code at low latency for model prediction.

This tutorial is worked through using an online learning platform. It is **not a fully-featured development environment for Tecton.** After you finish this tutorial, you'll be prompted to set up your own local development environment that you can use to go further.

Let's get started!

*Note: your Katacoda environment is currently downloading Tecton dependencies. Please wait a moment while these are installed.*
