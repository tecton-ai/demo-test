Welcome to the Tecton Interactive Walkthrough. This walkthrough is intended to get you started working with Tecton.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Use declarative code to put a feature into production.
2. Push feature code.
3. Retrieve feature code.

This tutorial is worked through using an online learning platform. It is **not a fully-featured development environment for Tecton.** After you finish this tutorial, you'll be prompted to set up your own local development environment that you can use to go further.
