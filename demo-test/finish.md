You've completed the Tecton Katacoda tutorial! To summarize:

1. You have defined a new feature using declarative code in a feature repository.
2. You have pushed feature values to Tecton for storage.
3. You have retrieved features from the feature store at low-latency for model prediction.

# Next steps

 **Tecton is not just an operational data store!** Tecton can:

- Store feature transformation logic
- Orchestrate and materialize feature pipelines
- Materialize features from batch and streaming data
- Transform features at request-time
- Perform point-in-time joins for historical training dataset generation
- Store and catalog feature datasets for later retrieval

You can explore this functionality and more in the [Advanced Tutorial](https://staging-docs.tecton.ai/trial/tutorial/01-getting-started.html). This tutorial also gets your local development environment set up with Tecton.
