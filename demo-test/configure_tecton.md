# Connect to your Tecton 

Run `tecton login --manual` to connect your terminal to your Tecotn cluster.

Navigate to the authentication URL in a new tab and log in. Paste the authentication code into your terminal to continue.

# Fetch a Tecton Feature Repository

In Tecton, features are configured using files on your local system, similar to Terraform.  

`git clone https://github.com/tecton-ai-ext/ad-serving-tutorial`{{execute}}

`cd ad-serving-tutorial/feature_store`{{execute}}
  
# Check your setup

You can compare compare your local repo to the production state:

`tecton plan`{{execute}}

If everything is set up correctly, you should see something like this:

```
Using workspace "prod"
âœ… Imported 13 Python modules from the feature repository
âœ… Collecting local feature declarations
âœ… Performing server-side validation of feature declarations
ðŸŽ‰ The remote and local state are the same, nothing to do!
```
